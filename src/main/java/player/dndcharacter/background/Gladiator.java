At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you. You can find a place to perform in any place that features combat for entertainment-perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting club.\n");
